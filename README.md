Sidebar launcher config
=======================
In the following path, there are some configs for your sidebar <br />
/usr/share/applications/ <br />
open then can see more configs  <br />

for example, I want to open terminator with a default size <br />
I can use the following setup  <br />
Exec=terminator --geometry=1600x930+0+0  <br />
which means when I open terminator, a parameter geometry will be set
